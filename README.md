# pytorch_flask
This is my Undergraduate graduation project:Trash classify based on Image Recognize.
The code mainly include preprocess dataset, training model and flask.
use pytorch to train the Resnet-18 model based on own image dataset to classify the trash;
and use flask to invoke the saved .pt model to predict the class of the images from Android front end.
The trained model is saved in .pt files.
